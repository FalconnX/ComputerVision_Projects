## **DenseNet:**

Implemented DenseNet architecture in keras. Achieved ~89%
accuracy in total 50 epochs.

Used data augmentation & Transfer learning.

Trained model for initial 18 epochs on 16x16 scaled down
image, which help CNN to extract basic features quickly initially. For remaining
32 epochs, trained model on original image 32x32.
